`idb` is formed of two components that have different responsibilities. Both these components are necessary for `idb` to run commands.

## The `idb` cli

This is a python3 cli that exposes all of the functionality that idb has to offer. As it is written in Python, this does not need to be run from the Mac to which your iPhone or iOS Simulator is attached.

The cli itself is a thin wrapper for a client of the `idb_companion`. All communication to the `idb_companion` is done via `gRPC`. This can be either through TCP or a Unix Domain Socket.

This client library can be imported into your own python3 code if you wish, or the CLI can be called from any other kind of automation.

## The `idb_companion`

The `idb_companion` is a `gRPC` server in Objective-C++ that runs on macOS. It talks to the native APIs that are used for automating Simulators and Devices. It links the `FBSimulatorControl` and `FBDeviceControl` Frameworks, which are part of the overall `idb` project.

When the `idb_companion` acts as `gRPC` server, it does so for a *single* iOS target (a device or simulator).

Additionally, the `idb_companion` has some commands that are deliberately unavailable from the python CLI, these operations are related to iOS Device management or operations on the lifecycle of a Simulator.

## Connections

The `idb` cli will, by default operate in one of two modes:

- If the `idb` cli is running on macOS, then it will automatically start and stop companions for all targets that are attached to your Mac. This means that you can run commands against any iOS Simulators that you have, as well as any devies that you have connected.
- If the `idb` cli is running on any other OS, it will not manage companions for you. In this case you can either "attach" companions via `idb connect` or explictly on every call using the `IDB_COMPANION=hostname:port` environment variable. This allows you to perform `idb` commands against companions running on other hosts. These facilities for companion discovery work on macOS also.
